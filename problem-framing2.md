## Domain

A one pit stop dummy traveling assistance and organizer that gives recommended tasks for beginner travelers to prepare for step by step with suggestions from AI without feeling overwhelmed and can travel with ease later.

## Problem
For beginner travelers or solo-traveling, especially to foregin countries, there's a lot one needs to plan ahead in order to travel with an ease of mind. Travelers would have to apply for visas if necessary (lots of paperwork, reading time, and wait/submit time), book living accomadations (hotels/inns/etc), different kind of reservations (entertainment, food, events, sceneries), searching for things to do (again sceneries/food/entertainment/events), transportation planning, budgetting, looking out for weathers, and many more to name. Different travelers would like to have their own plan made according to themselves instead of following guides, but the mentioned responsibilities are already a lot to handle and can be forgotten sometimes.
