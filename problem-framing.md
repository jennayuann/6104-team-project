# Problem Framing
## Domain
A digital meal ordering system that enables students to submit menu or custom food requests directly to chefs, who can view and manage incoming orders in real time.


## Problem
Many dinging solutions for students involve allowing students to order specific custome meal versions. Things like ordering an omlet, stir fry or a buerget are often done through long queues where the chef ust remember what each has ordered and cook them while student have to wait in long lines for their food. A solution to this would be to allow for requests to be put in early and worked on so that they are prepared for when people arrive.
