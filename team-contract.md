## The expected level of achievement and effort for each team member (what grades do you expect to get? how much time do you plan to put in?);



My expected level of achievement for myself would be contributing to some parts of the backend concepts and testing and working user experience for the frontend. I'm less confident in the aesthetic design of how the frontend visual should look like. I would put effort into making sure getting the backend concepts unit tested if possible for the scale of it (like there's an exact expected answer instead of some AI response or images). I would also make sure database collections are organized and can be referenced correctly by the code. I'm thinking of working on the code for 8 hours a week and then there might be an additional 4 hour debugging buffer time just trying to get a concept/feature working. Grades wise, I'm expecting for B or above. I'm not looking into creating really hard features because that requires too much time on top of other classes.



## Personal goals for each team member (building a great app? learning a particular skill?);



For me, I just want to experience building an app from scratch to a whole working full-stack one. I'm ok if the idea of the app is not unique or innovating. I want to continue practicing on organizing the backend concepts and be able to add working features to expand into a more round-about app. I don't have a particular skill in mind to practice because that would take more time for me in the project to build something and the skill level might not be enough for the complexity of the app for a 4 person team. 

### Cole:
My goal is to gain experience building a complete project from start to finish, with a particular emphasis on writing clean, modular code. Although I’ve built and deployed projects before, I want to focus more on understanding and implementing open connections and features that require active state management. Additionally, I’m interested in database and conceptual design, since I’ve struggled in the past with clearly defining data types and data structures. I believe this project will give me the opportunity to improve in these areas and contribute meaningfully to the team.


## How quality of work will be maintained (reviewing each others' code? team review meetings? pair programming?);



Reviewing each other's code before pushing to main. Team meetings to decide on next steps, changing the project concept/ideas, or reassigning task differently.



## How tasks will be assigned, and what to do if deadlines are missed;



Product backlog and people can freely sign up for the described task. If deadlines are missed, prioritized in finishing for the missed deadline. It would be better if one can give others a heads up that they can't finish on time to help to finish before the deadline. 



## How decisions will be made and any disagreements resolved.

I can just follow the majority rules if the skill set of the assigned person is suitable for the task. If the demand of the task is above for the assigned person or for the entire team, to be able to deliver a working project, I would want to tone down the complexity and come back to it later. If there's tie in disagreement, we can pitch it to the TA to ask for advice on what is better.
