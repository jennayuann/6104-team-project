## 1. The expected level of achievement and effort for each team member (what grades do you expect to get? how much time do you plan to put in?);

### Jing:

My expected level of achievement for myself would be contributing to some parts of the backend concepts and testing and working user experience for the frontend. I'm less confident in the aesthetic design of how the frontend visual should look like. I would put effort into making sure getting the backend concepts unit tested if possible for the scale of it (like there's an exact expected answer instead of some AI response or images). I would also make sure database collections are organized and can be referenced correctly by the code. I'm thinking of working on the code for 8 hours a week and then there might be an additional 4 hour debugging buffer time just trying to get a concept/feature working. Grades wise, I'm expecting for B or above. I'm not looking into creating really hard features because that requires too much time on top of other classes.

### Jenna:

Looking at the grade breakdown for this project, I believe earning a high grade in the A/B range is very attainable since the breakdown emphasizes incremental progress. Therefore, I am aiming for an A to B range for this project. As for time commitment, it will likely vary week to week depending on the tasks I’m responsible for, but based on Project 1, I’m estimating around 12–14 hours per week.

### Ivy

Every week, I'll expect myself to spend around 10-12 hours on the project, but this may also depend on what I'm working. I will expect myself to complete tasks assigned to me that week and meet deadlines. I will be aiming for a grade that is at least a B, hopefully an A.

## 2. Personal goals for each team member (building a great app? learning a particular skill?);

### Jing:

For me, I just want to experience building an app from scratch to a whole working full-stack one. I'm ok if the idea of the app is not unique or innovating. I want to continue practicing on organizing the backend concepts and be able to add working features to expand into a more round-about app. I don't have a particular skill in mind to practice because that would take more time for me in the project to build something and the skill level might not be enough for the complexity of the app for a 4 person team.

### Cole:

My goal is to gain experience building a complete project from start to finish, with a particular emphasis on writing clean, modular code. Although I’ve built and deployed projects before, I want to focus more on understanding and implementing open connections and features that require active state management. Additionally, I’m interested in database and conceptual design, since I’ve struggled in the past with clearly defining data types and data structures. I believe this project will give me the opportunity to improve in these areas and contribute meaningfully to the team.

### Ivy:

My goal for this fullstack project is to gain more experience working on the entire stack while improving my engineering practices. I want to focus on designing modular concepts that make the application easier to extend and maintain and on building an accessible frontend interface. Also, I hope to improve my communication skills and gain more experience in working on a team and how to work collaboratively on a coding project.

### Jenna:

My goal for this project is to build an application that feels both rewarding and fulfilling, something that I will be proud to share with others. Since we’re working as a team this time, I want to tackle a larger-scale project where I can really put my technical and creative skills to use. Further, I hope to improve my full-stack skills and software engineering practices by writing clean, modular, and maintable code that's easy for others to understand and build upon.

## 3. Frequency, length and location of team meetings;

We plan to meet at least once a week for about an hour to discuss team updates, review progress, conduct code reviews, and plan for the upcoming week. Additional check-ins can be added throughout the week as needed to track progress or resolve issues. For our main weekly meeting, meeting in-person is preferred and will take place somewhere convenient for the team that paricular week, such as the Student Center. The shorter, more frequent check-ins can be held over Zoom if necessary.

## 4. How quality of work will be maintained (reviewing each others' code? team review meetings? pair programming?);

We plan to maintain the quality of our work by reviewing each other’s code before merging to the main branch. Also, we’ll hold regular team meetings (preferably in-person) to discuss next steps, evaluate conflicts, adjust project vision, and reassign tasks as needed.

## 5. How tasks will be assigned, and what to do if deadlines are missed;

Tasks will be managed through a product backlog, and each team member can freely sign up for a task based on their interests and strengths. The tasks with higher importance on the product backlog will be top priority of the team. Each team member should give the others a heads-up in advance if they will miss a deadline so the team can coordinate to make sure the work is finished on time.

## 6. How decisions will be made and any disagreements resolved.

Decisions will generally be made based on majority agreement. For more significant decisions, we’ll meet in person to discuss before finalizing, while smaller decisions can be handled through our group chat. In the event of a tie, we can consult the TA for guidance if that's applicable. Other disagreements will be resolved during our regular check-ins, and for urgent issues, we’ll hold an emergency Zoom meeting to resolve them.
