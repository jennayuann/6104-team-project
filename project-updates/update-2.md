## Logistics
- Date: 11/20/2025
- Time: 4:30-5:30pm
- Location: Zoom

## Agenda
- Each member give a brief update on their work and questions/issues they have
- Go over the questions other students had about our pitch
- Watch the GuangDong Tigers' pitch video again and start discussing peer critique assignment
- Set up next week's TA check-in (likely Monday or Tuesday over Zoom)

## Progress Report
Last week and this past week, we met up and decided on a new project idea, submitted our problem framing, and created our pitch. As we worked on the functional design, we fleshed out the application details, such as the concepts, syncs, color palette, typography, and development plan. 

## Design Changes
Instead of our initial digital meal ordering system, we are now working on a tool where users can import and query their network. Over the week we have also adjusted our features from problem framing into more specific concepts and syncs.

Below is the responsibilites each team members as taken on for the Alpha checkpoint:

| Phase                | Backend Lead    | Frontend Lead | Focused Concept(s)                 |
|----------------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| Alpha 1 (Network)    | Ivy            | Jing          | PublicProfile, MultiSourceNetwork   |
| Alpha 2 (Search)     | Jenna          | Jing          | SemanticSearch                      |
| Alpha 3 (Importing)  | Cole Ruehle    | Jing          | MultiSourceNetwork (import flows)   |

## Issues
- Certain application details are still ambiguous (e.g., notifying non-users their presence on the application).
- Regular team check-ins: haven't decided on a day and time for our weekly check-ins.

## Plans & Decisions
[Will be discussed at meeting]
