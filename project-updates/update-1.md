## Logistics
- Time: 4:30-5:30pm
- Location: 32-G431

## Agenda
- 4:30-5:00pm: Settle on a project idea (discuss ones listed below)
- 5:00-5:30pm: Discuss plans for next week

## Progress Report
We submitted our Problem Framing for our idea of a MIT-based digital meal ordering system but received feedback that it's infeasible due to institutional barriers, such as the integration of MIT's meal swipe system. So we've been ideating new project ideas, namely the ones below.

## Design Changes
Below are the new project ideas we've come up with:

### 1. Travel Assistance and Organizer
Solution: A one pit stop dummy traveling assistance and organizer that gives recommended tasks for beginner travelers to prepare for step by step with suggestions from AI without feeling overwhelmed and can travel with ease later.

Problem: For beginner travelers or solo-traveling, especially to foregin countries, there's a lot one needs to plan ahead in order to travel with an ease of mind. Travelers would have to apply for visas if necessary (lots of paperwork, reading time, and wait/submit time), book living accomadations (hotels/inns/etc), different kind of reservations (entertainment, food, events, sceneries), searching for things to do (again sceneries/food/entertainment/events), transportation planning, budgetting, looking out for weathers, and many more to name. Different travelers would like to have their own plan made according to themselves instead of following guides, but the mentioned responsibilities are already a lot to handle and can be forgotten sometimes.

### 2. Student Marketplace
Solution: De-clutter the dorm spam for MIT students who only want to checkout items for sale or giving out. Simplifies the process of dormspaming and being able to find the desired items in the sea of dormspam emails about sales.

Problem: Emails can get pushed down really fast since dormspam is in outlook with other academic stuffs. Also, students often messed up on the dormspamming rules in order for one email to pass through all dorms.

## Issues
- Settling on a meaningful project: the idea that we settled on initially had institutional barriers that we didn't consider. We need to settle on a project quickly so we can start working.
- Regular team check-ins: haven't decided on a day and time for our weekly check-ins.

## Plans & Decisions
- We discussed many project ideas and ended up settling on a network query tool.
