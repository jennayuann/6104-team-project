### Disambiguation of Mutliple Users

### Ethics of importing
Our original plan was to use a system similar to those commercially available online, which scrape profile information on a per-profile basis (e.g., profile_id → information). However, despite these sources existing, many are vague about how they accomplish this. Upon reviewing the LinkedIn API, we discovered that a change was made around six years ago to limit the amount of information accessible through standard means. This is because LinkedIn decided to monetize access to this data, making it available only to their corporate partners—requiring negotiation of a hefty payment package. Despite these factors, it is clearly still possible to get information from LinkedIn, and since LinkedIn still permits it (for a price), the use of that data is not inherently unethical. However, after this research, it became clear that knowingly subverting the explicit changes LinkedIn has made would be unethical.

The second option I considered was using a method similar to "Sign in with LinkedIn." If you have ever signed in with Google, you may have been prompted with a question asking to share your email or contacts with the app. My hope was that, since this is a common paradigm centered around the user's own information, this would be possible with LinkedIn. However, from developer testimonials, it appears that the sign in with LinkedIn feature is primarily designed for authentication, not for streamlined integration or data import. Therefore, the information we could access would be limited.

This put me in a difficult position to design an importing system that would both meet our ethical standards and comply with the restrictions set by LinkedIn. While continuing to scrape could be possible (and many others do, even scraping and selling the data of accounts they do not own), that approach seemed inappropriate.

In searching for apps that provide value while allowing import of data they are not directly connected to, I found an example: https://www.swipestats.io. This service allows users of dating apps like Tinder to visualize their swiping and interaction history. Dating app companies do not like this use case, because it is often used by people to comment on the futility of dating apps—creating visualizations about the ratio of time spent using the app to actual dates or relationships. As a result, the app cannot integrate directly with Tinder through an API or similar mechanism. The solution they developed is to allow users to import their own data via a file upload. The app provides instructions on how to request your data from Tinder and which file to upload to quickly import everything. In fact, it does not offer any other way to add data.

Despite these limitations, the app is undoubtedly popular. You can see hundreds of people posting its visualizations in forums like https://www.reddit.com/r/Tinder/. This inspired the implementation of our import concept: we allow users to request their LinkedIn data (with instructions on how to do so), then import that data into our system—along with supporting other manual additions and data from different sources (since an LLM will review any file passed in and attempt to match it dynamically to our internal concept).

### Frontend Design

A critical aspect of an end design that I think is really important that we learned throughout this process is the question of separation of the idea of what we have in the background and what the user needs to do. Throughout the process, it seems like in design. We really didn't think through that as much as we should have, but it immediately became a parent that that's the first thing that the users cared about. They really cared about journeys To get to an end. For example, part of what they were thinking about when they looked at the front end was not can I sign in something that they were able to do successfully but in fact, they were interested in in this process of signing in how can we break this up so while it all may be using the same sign in concept it makes it clear to the user what they're doing and each place and move through ask me for my name first, then the key my picture then the key pieces of information then give me the optional pieces of information or some clues on the best way to start and then finally create my a rather than have that all available at the same time. The second thing that's really important I think is that naming and decisions about what elements and buttons are included should not be related to the back end design at all the names for what things technically are with notes and edges are not very relevant to users and well that makes it easy for us to discuss design decisions. It makes it very difficult for a user to come in and use the app who hasn't thought about it.

 Finally, I think the idea of simplifying what the user is doing is important a discussion that we had during our user testing was that apps like Instagram and other modern major pieces of software are designed to seamlessly put you on little paths while they may have a lot of extra settings and other things that you can interact with the real goal is that it will confidently place you on a path of a small set of actions to do what you wanna do if you want to post it puts you in a little carousel that takes you through the steps of posting even if you want to comment it puts you in a little set of actions where you click on the thing you wanna comment on you write down the information you want you add your tags you add your emojis then you click send if you wanna share something. You click the share button then there's maybe three or four different things that you have to do, but it's done in a small sequence so that it's almost like a little jump out. This was a lot of how they were discussing the processes that we were asking to do as tasks and they were wondering if we knew that these were tasks that were important why couldn't we design to match that? I thought this was a really good callout and it really shaped our choices in design designing the second version after we got our Feedback.
