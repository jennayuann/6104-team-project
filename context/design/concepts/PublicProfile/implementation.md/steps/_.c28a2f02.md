# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

* **concept**: PublicProfile \[User]

* **purpose**: Provide a concise, public-facing description of a user that others can quickly scan and interpret.

* **principle**: When a user creates a public profile with a headline, attributes, and links, anyone can later view that user’s profile and consistently see the same information; if the user updates their profile, viewers will see the updated information the next time it is accessed.

* **state**:
  * a set of `Profiles` with
    * `user` User
    * `headline` String
    * `attributes` set of String
    * `links` set of String

* **actions**:
  * `createProfile (user: User, headline: String, attributes: set of String, links: set of String): Empty`
    * **requires**:
      * No `Profiles` entry exists for `user`.
      * `user` exists.
      * `headline` is not empty.
    * **effects**:
      * Creates a new profile for `user` with the provided headline, attributes, and links.

  * `updateProfile (user: User, headline: String?, attributes: set of String?, links: set of String?): Empty`
    * **requires**:
      * A `Profiles` entry exists for `user`.
      * If `headline` is provided, it is not empty.
    * **effects**:
      * Updates each provided field on the profile.
      * Leaves unprovided fields unchanged.
      * Overwrites fields if explicitly provided as empty.

  * `deleteProfile (user: User): Empty`
    * **requires**:
      * A `Profiles` entry exists for `user`.
    * **effects**:
      * Removes the profile for `user`.
